# Data-Visualization-SuperMarket-Analysis
Data Visualization using Tableau is performed to generate meaningful insights from the sales data of supermarket. 
It is difficult to interpret thousands of records, thus data visualization comes to the rescue. Tableau is an easy to use tool that supports Data Analysis. I used it to interpret sales data of a supermarket.
I thought to maximize profit. Eventually, I figured out Tables though sold 4th highest do not derive profit. I plotted various charts and finally in a scatter plot between profit and discount, I figured out an inverse proportionality relation between the two.
On varification through other charts as well, finally I was able to draw an insight that if we want profit on Tables then stop giving any discount on it!

There are interactive dashboards, story and various sheets containing different plots that help in the analysis and interpretation of data.

Colors: Green indicates the profit, darker the green more is the profit and vice versa. Similarly, red incdicates loss, lighter the red less is the loss and vice versa.
